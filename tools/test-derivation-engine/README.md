# @domainspec/test-derivation-engine

Deterministic test-derivation engine. Compiles a feature's **canonical Markdown feature docs** into **byte-stable test obligations** — with **no LLM and no network** in the derivation path, so determinism holds _by construction_ (paper claim C2).

> Replaces the LLM-backed `domainspec-generate-tests` / `domainspec-test-designer` derivation. See the design baseline in
> [`../../development/deterministic-test-derivation-engine/`](../../development/deterministic-test-derivation-engine/)
> (SPEC, ARCHITECTURE, GLOSSARY, WORK-PACK) and the refinement evidence in
> [`../../development/refinement-runs/2026-06-12-test-derivation-c2-cluster/`](../../development/refinement-runs/2026-06-12-test-derivation-c2-cluster/).

## Pipeline

```
parse (docs → G) → derive (δ: pure) → obligation_key (sha1) → emit_spec / emit_tests
```

The parser accepts two explicit input dialects:

- legacy aspect documents (`states.md`, `operations.md`, and siblings); or
- normalized v2 `SPEC.md` when no aspect documents are present.

The normalized adapter derives structural conformance obligations for declared
concepts, relationships, fields, and attributes. It does not infer behavioral
semantics or path equations from prose.

Generate a machine-readable boundary receipt with:

```bash
pnpm exec tsx src/cli.ts receipt <feature-directory>
# add --out to write RESIDUE-RECEIPT.engine.json beside the input spec
```

The receipt separates normalized target declarations, source-evidenced preserved
relationship rows, explicitly omitted source rows, parser rejections, and
binding-side commitments. It is structural accounting, not a claim of semantic
satisfiability or application generation.

- `src/grammar/` — strict-grammar parser → typed concept graph `G` (SWU-ENG-001)
- `src/ir/` — `G` types (Node/Edge/Obligation), deterministic serialization
- `src/rules/` — pure δ rule functions with **exact** cardinalities (SWU-ENG-003)
- `src/keys/` — `obligation_key = sha1(source_anchor | rule_type | canonical_params)` ✅ implemented
- `src/emit/` — `emit_spec` (TEST-SPEC.md) and `emit_tests` (runnable vitest)
- `src/roundtrip/` — L0 falsification gate: engine set ⊇ committed ⇒ PASS

## Status

**Active deterministic engine.** Aspect-document parsing, normalized-`SPEC.md`
structural parsing, derivation rules, content-addressed obligation keys, round-trip
comparison, receipt accounting, and test emission are implemented and tested. See
`CRAFT.md` and the test suite for the current bounded gates; this status does not
claim semantic satisfiability or application generation.

## Develop

```bash
# from this folder (deps resolved via the workspace toolchain / pnpm dlx tsx)
pnpm install        # or: pnpm dlx tsx, matching repo convention
pnpm run typecheck  # tsc --noEmit
pnpm run test       # vitest run
```
