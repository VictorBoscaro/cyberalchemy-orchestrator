## Pilot Decision Gate

| decision | considered options | selected option | rationale | source | timestamp |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| scope | Wave 1 runtime only, all documented features, custom subset | Wave 1 runtime features only | Keep pilot constrained to implemented runtime behavior and exclude planned or governance-only slices. | AskQuestions | 2026-04-30 |
| visibility | internal only, invite-only external, public | Public | Pilot is intended for real-world exposure and validation under production-like visibility. | AskQuestions | 2026-04-30 |
| policy strictness | block any FLAG, allow FLAG with no P0 blockers, allow FLAG without due dates | Strict block on any FLAG | Enforces highest safety posture for pilot launch decisions. | AskQuestions | 2026-04-30 |
| rounding | half-even, half-up, truncate | Half-even (bankers) | Minimizes aggregate rounding bias across repeated financial operations. | AskQuestions | 2026-04-30 |
| auth gate | fail-closed RBAC, RBAC with service-token override, best-effort auth | Fail-closed RBAC required | Prevents unauthorized mutation paths under partial identity context. | AskQuestions | 2026-04-30 |
| dedupe gate | DB unique plus idempotency key, idempotency key only, best-effort dedupe | DB unique plus idempotency key | Requires deterministic duplicate prevention at request and persistence layers. | AskQuestions | 2026-04-30 |
| audit metadata | full envelope, core envelope, minimal | Full audit envelope | Preserves forensic traceability for pilot decisions and mutations. | AskQuestions | 2026-04-30 |
| failure policy | fail closed, fail open with alert, degrade to read-only | Fail closed | Avoids partial correctness under policy, telemetry, or auth failures. | AskQuestions | 2026-04-30 |
| decision model | central release board, per-feature owner, hybrid | Central release board | Keeps go/no-go authority consistent across cross-feature dependencies. | AskQuestions | 2026-04-30 |
| verification command substitution | targeted must-pass plus docs index, full backend plus web plus e2e, smoke checks | Full backend plus web plus e2e suite | Maximizes confidence under strict block policy. | AskQuestions | 2026-04-30 |
