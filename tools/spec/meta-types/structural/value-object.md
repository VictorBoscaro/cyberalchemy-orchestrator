# Value Object — meta-type card (Structural)

**Companion to** [`value-object.schema.yml`](./value-object.schema.yml). Prose is non-normative.

## Formal criterion
A concept declared **Value Object** is well-formed IFF:

1. **no identity** — no field row is flagged `Identity` (a VO is equal-by-fields, not by ID).
2. **typedness** — every field row declares a non-empty `Type`.
3. **equality** — the concept section declares an **Equality** clause.

## Distinguisher vs Entity
An Entity **has** an identity field; a Value Object has **none** and declares equality. An identity-bearing
concept declared Value Object is a mis-typed Entity → **rejected as Value Object**.

## Edge participation (DS-D8 slice)
- SOURCE of: `contains`
- TARGET of: `contains`, `produces-for`

## Fixtures
- positive: [`spec/__fixtures__/mt/value-object-ok.md`](../../__fixtures__/mt/value-object-ok.md)
- negative: [`spec/__fixtures__/mt/value-object-bad.md`](../../__fixtures__/mt/value-object-bad.md) — identity-bearing → rejected.

## Boundary
Shape only; equality is checked as a **declared clause**, never by proving semantic equality (moat).
