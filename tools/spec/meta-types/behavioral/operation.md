# Operation — meta-type card (Behavioral)

**Companion to** [`operation.schema.yml`](./operation.schema.yml). Prose is non-normative.

## Formal criterion
A concept declared **Operation** is well-formed IFF its `Attribute | Value` table declares
`state_change = yes` (the write side — it mutates entity state).

## Distinguisher vs Query
An Operation changes state (`state_change=yes`); a Query is read-only (`state_change=no`).

## Edge participation (DS-D8 slice)
- SOURCE of: `performs`, `emits`, `produces-for`
- TARGET of: `enforces`, `applies`

## Fixtures
- positive: [`spec/__fixtures__/mt/operation-ok.md`](../../__fixtures__/mt/operation-ok.md)
- negative: [`spec/__fixtures__/mt/operation-bad.md`](../../__fixtures__/mt/operation-bad.md) — read-only → rejected.

## Boundary
The discriminator is the **declared** `state_change` attribute — shape only, never inferred from the
operation body (that would be the engine moat).
