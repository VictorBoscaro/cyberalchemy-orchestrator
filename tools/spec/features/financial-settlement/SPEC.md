# Financial Settlement — feature pack (L0 POC)

> First **real** v2 feature pack. Promoted build-from-owned from the engine fixture
> `test-derivation-engine/__fixtures__/financial-settlement/` (backend aspect files; graph typed by
> the spec-ontology toy, 23 nodes) into the v2 feature-pack shape and typed to the backend meta-type
> schemas under `spec/meta-types/`. Its purpose is to make the node-plane validators **non-vacuous**
> (APE package, `DEC-DSV2-APE-L0-DOMAIN` → reuse financial-settlement).
>
> **Node + edge plane.** R3 now supplies root relationship signatures under `definitions/relationships/`.
> This pack exercises `validate-content` over node criteria and `validate:rels` over a small valid graph.

## What This Feature Owns

Settlement generation for a player over a period: compute the settlement result, apply makeup debt,
and create the resulting ledger transactions (MAKEUP_APPLIED / PAYOUT).

## SettlementTransaction

An identity-bearing settlement ledger entry — a persisted transaction row created by settlement
generation.

| Field | Type | Required | Identity | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| transactionId | UUID | yes | yes | unique transaction identity |
| type | SettlementTransactionType | yes |  | MAKEUP_APPLIED or PAYOUT |
| amount | integer | yes |  | transaction amount (non-negative) |
| date | string | yes |  | settlement end date |

## SettlementResult

A value defined entirely by its fields; no identity.

| Field | Type | Required | Identity | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| playerId | string | yes |  | player the result is for |
| periodStart | string | yes |  | inclusive period start |
| periodEnd | string | yes |  | inclusive period end |
| totalProfit | integer | yes |  | derived profit sum |
| totalPayout | integer | yes |  | non-negative payout total |

**Equality:** two SettlementResult are equal iff all fields are equal for the same player and period.

## SettlementTransactionType

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| MAKEUP_APPLIED | debt-reduction transaction entry |
| PAYOUT | player payout transaction entry |
